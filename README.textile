h2. How it works

h3. API-key and secret

Request your api-key and secret at http://www.tokbox.com/opentok/tools/js/apikey. You can use the staging environment for testing. The gem uses this staging environment by default.

h3. Usage

With the following code, you can generate a valid @session_id@.
<pre>
    @api_key = 0            # should be a number
    @api_secret = ''        # should be a string
    @location = 'localhost' # give Opentok a hint on where you are running your application
    
    @opentok = OpenTok::OpenTokSDK.new @api_key, @api_secret
    
    puts @opentok.create_session(@host)
</pre>
